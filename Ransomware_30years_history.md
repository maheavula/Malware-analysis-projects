# History of ransomware 

The first instance of what we now know as ransomware was called the AIDS Trojan because of who it was targeting – delegates who'd attended the World Health Organization AIDS conference in Stockholm in 1989.

malicious code that installed itself onto MS-DOS systems and counted the number of the times the machine was booted. When the machine was booted for the 90th time, the trojan hid all the directories and encrypted the names of all the files on the drive, making it unusable.

 that they needed to send $189 by post to an address in Panama in order to regain access to their system.

It was a ransom demand for payment in order for the victim to regain access to their computer: that made this the first ransomware.

Fortunately, the encryption used by the trojan was weak,researchers attempting to reverse engineer it.

After a 20-year hiatus, ransomware re-emerged in the early 2000s. These early attacks were relatively simple, often using weak encryption and making demands for small amounts of money. Examples include the "Police Locker" attack, which would change the user's desktop to a note claiming to be from law enforcement, stating the machine had been locked due to suspected unlawful activity.

It was at this point that ransomware turned towards encrypting files, so as to really turn the screw on victims, although it was rare for the ransom demands to be more than a few hundred dollars as the targets were still mostly home users – and because the ransoms were paid in standard currencies, it wasn't the most covert operation.

But the Bitcoin boom helped change everything and soon criminals distributing ransomware were demanding their ransoms should be paid in cryptocurrency

By 2016, ransomware-as-a-service had become common, with the creators of malware families like Cerber leasing out the ability to conduct attacks in return for a cut off the profits. 

Despite this, ransomware still remained somewhat under the radar outside information security circles, but in May 2017, that changed forever with the arrival of WannaCry ransomware.

WannaCry was spreading around the world with the help of EternalBlue, a leaked NSA hacking tool that had been made public months earlier.

The damage would have been much wider if security researchers hadn't found the killswitch for the attack, which was later blamed on North Korea.

that wasn't the end of ransomware as organisations continued to leave their networks open to compromise by cyber attackers who'd soon find yet another new way to make ransomware even more powerful – and more lucrative – than before, as hackers realised they could spread the malware with more than just phishing attacks.


In many cases, it's seen as the lesser of two evils – because restoring the network from scratch could take weeks and not only could it cost as much, the organisation will lose large amounts of business all the time the network is down. So victims pay up, demonstrating to attackers that ransomware works.

But by doing one simple thing, organisations of all sizes could counter the threat posed by ransomware attacks: making sure they have offline backups of their systems and make sure that those backups are regularly tested.
